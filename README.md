I will be developing a complete website for a real state agency for the next months (as a remote part-time job where I can manage my times enterely)
And  software that helps the employees to manage the properties, dates, costs controls, keys, customer tracking and more.

With React.js and Java Spring Boot. Later I will be uploading wich tools, librarys, frameworks and everything I use and a proper explanation about them such as where and how do I use X or Y tool.

The firsts 2-3 weeks I spent most of my time working with the owners of the agency and their employees to know what they WANT, what they HAVE and what they NEED.

1) Make a proper research before doing any prototype: (General knowledge of the company. Firsts things to consider when making the frontend)
    1.1) knowing the main target audience
    1.2) Using the colours they been using the last 20 years and the logo they have
2) organize what information they have and determine what needs to be used: (General knowledge of the company administration, HOW and with WHAT information they work. First things to consider when making the manager)
    2.1) Starting with a canvas blackboard with most of the information collected
    2.1.1)![image](https://github.com/Test576M/property-managaner-and-web/assets/93354994/9f44c010-e32b-457b-bc16-bb3b4accf8ff)
    2.2) Next I had to make a proper UML (with app.diagrams.net) before start making the BD in MySQL.
3) Start doing prototypes on figma to show, discuse and choose what would be the bests options taking in consideration a proper ux/ui design, the company requeriments, the target audience and personal tips.

After a week I finished a proper table with the most important information to have in the bd

while we talked over the main problems of the agency I had been organized the folders and photos into an intuitive model where they can easly find any thing they need without lookin for several minutes into desorganized folders. (I didn't finish yet, the main ssd has around 350gb of information) In the end of this process I will have to make something that can be used to search by name and type of fyle, still reasearching about that.. 

UPDATE 
I had to study through youtube "Google app scripts" model so I can make an easly and intuitive use for a google sheet that they want to use to take care about the KEYS and the OWNERS of the properties

UPDATE
After some weeks I finish the main table to control the data 
The columns names are:
