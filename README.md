# property-manager-and-web

UPDATE 04th October. 
Almost done the few last projects I started some weeks ago
1) whatsapp-bot (with some IA .. why not?
2) The UI for the DB with the scrapped data
3) The 5) point from the 19th of August has passed through some troubles ...
By the end of the month, these 3 points have to be completed so they can work properly

----------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 19th August.
What have I been doing the last few months? 
I started working for two real state companies where I re-made every aspect of their daily life and job routine
The most remarkable things are:
1) They stopped using accounting books as the main means of tracking
2) All documents are uploaded to the cloud in a simple and easy-to-understand way, and the path of the folders to reach the searched documentation is easy to follow
3) Tables with intuitive navigation to reach the most important information about the properties
4) Tables with information on the properties which are handled by their colleagues (With some web scrapping... to take the information and manage such numbers of properties without the need to write one by one into the tables)
5) (almost completed) A easy way to do contracts is by filling out a form and replacing the data with a document that had been created before. So the personnel doesn't have to copy, paste and rewrite previous documents wasting too much time looking for the information that hasn't been deleted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE
After some weeks I finish the main table to control the data 
The column's names are:

I will upload the features as gifts or short videos.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 
I had to study through youtube "Google app scripts" model so I could make an easy and intuitive use for a Google sheet that they want to use to take care of the KEYS and the OWNERS of the properties

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will be developing a complete website for a real state agency for the next months (as a remote part-time job where I can manage my times entirely)
And  software that helps the employees to manage the properties, dates, costs controls, keys, customer tracking, and more.

With React.js and Java Spring Boot. Later I will be uploading which tools, libraries, frameworks, and everything I use and a proper explanation about them such as where and how do I use X or Y tools.

For the first 2-3 weeks I spent most of my time working with the owners of the agency and their employees to know what they WANT, what they HAVE, and what they NEED.

1) Do proper research before doing any prototype: (General knowledge of the company. Firsts things to consider when making the frontend)
    1.1) knowing the main target audience
    1.2) Using the colours they been using the last 20 years and the logo they have
2) organize what information they have and determine what needs to be used: (General knowledge of the company administration, HOW and with WHAT information they work. First things to consider when making the manager)
    2.1) Starting with a canvas blackboard with most of the information collected
    2.1.1)![image](https://github.com/Test576M/property-managaner-and-web/assets/93354994/9f44c010-e32b-457b-bc16-bb3b4accf8ff)
    2.2) Next I had to make a proper UML (with app.diagrams.net) before start making the BD in MySQL.
3) Start doing prototypes on Figma to show, discuss and choose what would be the bests options taking into consideration a proper ux/ui design, the company requirements, the target audience, and personal tips.

After a week I finished a proper table with the most important information to have in the bd

while we talked over the main problems of the agency I had been organized the folders and photos into an intuitive model where they can easily find anything they need without looking for several minutes into disorganized folders. (I didn't finish yet, the main ssd has around 350GB of information) At the end of this process, I will have to make something that can be used to search by name and type of file, still researching that...
